- Click on a button named `code`

- Copy the project URL as displayed on the HTTPS tab

- Open your command prompt if you're running the Windows Operating System. On Linux, open your terminal

- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be. Leave it as it is if the current location is where you want the project to be.

  `$ git clone https://github.com/Alejgl04/mf-store.git` <em>Press Enter key</em><br>

- After you get the project aiming at the desired directory, you need to install dependencies by running npm install.

### Usage 

- Make sure you have npm and node installed.

- I recommend the use of VS Code as a code editor, but you can use any code editor.

- Run in your terminal `npm start` OR `yarn start` to run the app in your default browser.

- You should see the todo form ready to be used.

- Add a name for the task owner (description is optional).
